It has been a while since I last posted on 'Oracle BI Bakboord'. A lot has happened since.  [Oracle OpenWorld 2011](http://bit.ly/suWqyH) eg. If you have a look at the number of Oracle BI subjects, you can see that Oracle BI is still 'Hot' at Oracle. This week I was able to visit the [Oracle Business Analytics Summit](http://t.co/eX75rRqE) in Nieuwegein, Holland. I had the opportunity to meet with clients, partners and Oracle employees. Oracle had managed to create an agenda with one common subject; 'Information' and what Oracle offers to manage and deliver this information to the end user.

A few different subjects where covered.



	
  * [Oracle and Endeca](http://bit.ly/vOtujs)

	
  * [Oracle Fusion Applications](http://bit.ly/rqPM1M)


	
  * [Oracle BI](http://obibb.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/fusion-applications-oracle-bi.png) in Oracle Fusion Applications
