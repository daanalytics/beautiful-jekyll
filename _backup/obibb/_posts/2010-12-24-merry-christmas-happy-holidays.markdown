Here in Holland we say something like; 'Vrolijk Kerstfeest' or 'Prettige Kerstdagen'. Over here it's clear what is meant by that, no questions asked. At the other end of the Atlantic Ocean it's a bigger [issue](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/12/18/decide-say-happy-holidays-merry-christmas/#content), what you say, while in the end we all  mean the same.

So to be on the safe side; I wish you, your family and your friends all the best. I hope you will have some pleasant days, with nice food & drinks.

To give this post a bit of a nerdy twist, you could also wish everybody; '[A Very Data Christmas](http://www.r-bloggers.com/a-very-data-christmas/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Rbloggers&utm_content=Twitter)'

Thanks for dropping by. I hope to see you here many times again.
