Although a few of us (like me) have to go for another week, 2011 is almost over. It has been an exciting year, again. I have made [switch](http://obibb.wordpress.com/2011/05/12/obibb-update/) from Scamander to Ebicus and Oracle had a few things to [announce](http://obibb.wordpress.com/2011/11/10/oracle-business-analytics-summit-2011/) regarding the Oracle BI Foundation.

Hopefully next year will be a thrilling year for me and you again. Just like last [year](http://obibb.wordpress.com/2010/12/24/merry-christmas-happy-holidays/);  I wish you, your family and your friends all the best. I hope you will have some pleasant days, with nice food & drinks.

Thanks for dropping by!!
