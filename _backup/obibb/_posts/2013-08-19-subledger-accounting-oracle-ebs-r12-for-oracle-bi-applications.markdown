I am currently reading the following [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071804145?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwgoodco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0071804145&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2); 'Oracle Business Intelligence Applications: Deliver Value Through Rapid Implementations'. As far as I know it's the first and only book on Oracle BI Applications. In Chapter 5: Financial Analytics there is a paragraph about analyzing on Subledger Accounting (SLA) Transactions. This functionality is not in the Out-of-the-Box version of Oracle BIA 7.9.6.3, but Oracle provides a patch to make SLA Transaction analyzing possible.

If you want more details about this patch, have look on My Oracle Support. Search for; Patch 13697336 - PROVISION FOR LOADING SUB-LEDGER SLA ENTRIES FOR EXCHANGE GAIN/LOSS (Patch)

It could be of added value to my current project, so I will check it out. More on this later.
