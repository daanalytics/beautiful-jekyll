The world is changing. People are asking for new kinds of rapidly changing data. This has a big impact on Business Intelligence and Information Management as we have known it for a long time. Therefore I look with great interest in Information Management Architectures in general and Oracle BI Solution Architectures in particular.

Information Management Architectures as a result is one thing, but the processes that lead to, and govern these Architectures is another. I did some (online) research and stumbled upon [The Open Group](http://www.opengroup.org).

"The Open Group is a global consortium that enables the achievement of business objectives through IT standards."

There are several Forums and Work Groups for Enterprise Architecture within The Open Group. Two of the were very interesting me;



	
  * "[The Open Group Architecture Forum](http://www.opengroup.org/getinvolved/forums/architecture) is the premier global environment for fostering the development and delivery of robust Enterprise Architecture ecosystems, and is responsible for the evolution of [TOGAF®](https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/g116). The mission of The Open Group Architecture Forum is to advance The Open Group’s vision of [Boundaryless Information Flow™](https://www3.opengroup.org/aboutus/vision/bif) ( achieved through global interoperability in a secure, reliable and timely manner)."

	
  * "[The Open Group ArchiMate® Forum](http://www.opengroup.org/getinvolved/forums/archimate) supports the use and dissemination of, and continued development of [ArchiMate®](https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/C13L), an open and independent modeling language used in Enterprise Architecture. Joining the ArchiMate® Forum enables you to actively support the use, dissemination, and further development of the ArchiMate® specification."


TOGAF is relatively [popular](http://blog.opengroup.org/category/enterprise-architecture-2/certifications/) in Holland, compared to other countries in the world.

Over the last two months I took a few classes with [The Unit Academy](http://www.theunitacademy.com/about-us). This resulted in two Certifications; [TOGAF 9 Certified](http://www.opengroup.org/certifications/togaf9-program) and [Archi](http://www.opengroup.org/certifications/archimate)[M](http://www.opengroup.org/certifications/archimate)[ate 2 Certified](http://www.opengroup.org/certifications/archimate). I would like to thank [Joost Bleijenberg](http://nl.linkedin.com/in/joostbleijenberg) and [Rienk de Kok](http://nl.linkedin.com/in/rienkdekok) from The Unit. The provided us with a training which served as a solid foundation to take all four (Level I and Level II) exams. The TOGAF exams as well as the ArchiMate were (very) theoretical. Nevertheless Joost and Rienk took a practical approach to make sure we understood the structure of both specifications.

Now it's back to the real world, where a lot of Processes and related Information (Technology) is not so well structured as we would like them to be. Enough work to be done 😏.
