Somewhere in the summer of 2010 the first 11g R1 release of Oracle Data Integrator ([ODI](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/data-integrator/overview/index.html)) became GA. ODI is the leading Data Integration platform within the Oracle Product Family. It seemed like a logical step that a book on ODI 11g would be launched. The Oracle ODI Product Management team have shared their knowledge into a book called; [Oracle Data Integrator 11g: Getting Started](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/184968068X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=oracledi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217153&creative=399701&creativeASIN=184968068X). This book presents the audience with a step-by-step tutorial. In the end the reader should be familiar, comfortable and successful with (the new features of) ODI 11g R1.

After the first 'Getting Started' book a more advanced book on ODI 11g seemed like a very logical next step.  The [Oracle Data Integrator 11g Cookbook](//www.packtpub.com/oracle-data-integrator-11g-cookbook/book) is a collection of recipes which cover the more advanced topics in ODI 11g.

[![Oracle Data Integrator 11g Cookbook](http://obibb.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/oracle-data-integrator-11g-cookbook.png)](http://obibb.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/oracle-data-integrator-11g-cookbook.png)Where the first book is more an introduction to ODI, the aim of the second book will uncover the more advanced features of ODI. Some basic knowledge of ODI is essential if you want to get the most out of the this Cookbook.

The Oracle Data Integrator 11g Cookbook is nicely structured. In a chronological order, the various components of ODI are covered. From Installation, Security, Variables, (inside) Knowledge Modules, Advanced Coding, Advanced ETL Processing to a Catch-all chapter which reveals the little know secrets and gives answers to several FAQ's.

Each chapter consists of several (related) recipes. Each recipe is a step-by-step explanation of a specific task. Sometimes you have to perform some actions to get ready for the (next) recipe. Next to that it's explained how things work. Last but not least, the recipes go beyond the steps necessary to complete a task in the; 'There's more'- and the 'See also'-sections of the recipe. Within the tasks you will find notes which give some additional information to the recipe. Screenshots, code-(snippets) and links to external sites (Documentation, Oracle Support, Blogs, etc.) complete the recipes.

Consider the Oracle Data Integrator 11g Cookbook as a written MasterClass. Probably even for the more experienced ODI consultants, this book will reveal something they didn't know before. I guess the authors succeeded in writing a book which differs from the first one and is still worth reading.

For me personally, I this book gives me more understanding of the capabilities of Oracle Data Integrator. I just recently (seriously) started exploring ODI. I would say that in this stage the [Oracle Data Integrator 11g: Getting Started](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/184968068X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=oracledi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217153&creative=399701&creativeASIN=184968068X) better fits my knowledge, but the  [Oracle Data Integrator 11g Cookbook](//www.packtpub.com/oracle-data-integrator-11g-cookbook/book) definitely is next on my reading list.

Enjoy reading this book.
