The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2011 annual report for this blog.

[![](http://www.wordpress.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/annual-reports/img/emailteaser.jpg)](/2011/annual-report/)

Here's an excerpt:


<blockquote>The Louvre Museum has 8.5 million visitors per year. This blog was viewed about **70,000** times in 2011. If it were an exhibit at the Louvre Museum, it would take about 3 days for that many people to see it.</blockquote>

I made another PDF-backup which you can download [here](http://obibb.wordpress.com/obibb-pdf-backup/).
