On a search for information I landed on two interesting Oracle Support documents regarding Oracle BI (Applications). There are two Product Information Centers;



	
  * Oracle Business Intelligence Applications (OBIA) -- Doc Id - **1318707.1**

	
  * Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE) -- Doc Id -** 1267009.1**


The Product Information Centers contain all sorts of documents and links to information regarding;

	
  * "Hot Topics" (White Papers, Data Model References, Master Notes, etc.)

	
  * Announcements (Press Releases)

	
  * Certification (Certification Matrices)

	
  * Documentation

	
  * Install

	
  * Manage

	
  * Upgrade (Considerations, Issues)

	
  * Performance


Could be very interesting to look at if you want some more information from Oracle themselves.
