Yesterday I had a conversation with one of my colleagues about 3 of the biggest Business Intelligence tools around. Next to IBM Cognos and SAP Business Objects, we were of course talking about the Oracle BI Suite.

The success of the Oracle BI Suite is for a great deal influenced by the active Oracle BI community. That's one of the reasons I started the [Interview series](http://obibb.wordpress.com/category/general/interviews/) on this blog, to get a picture of this community. Next to that Oracle itself is very open, when it comes to downloading and trying their software. [Oracle OTN](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/index.html) and [Oracle eDelivery](http://edelivery.oracle.com/) belong to my favorite sites.

With the coming release of Oracle BI 11g, there will be a lot of knowledge to gain and to share. I am confident that the Oracle BI Community will become very active when then next Oracle BI 11g is generally available.

If you want to get information about the Oracle BI products, where will you start looking? Alex has done a great effort to get all active Oracle BI bloggers in one central place; In his [blogroll](http://siebel-essentials.blogspot.com/2010/07/blognroll.html). He has one condition: You have to be active. So my advise will be: Keep on sharing!

For those of you who want to make a fresh start with Oracle BI EE, please check John's [blog](http://obiee101.blogspot.com/2009/07/obiee-how-to-get-started.html). He has an up-to-date page with all the details on; How to start with Oracle BI EE.

Let usÂ all keep the Oracle BI Community alive and kickin'.
