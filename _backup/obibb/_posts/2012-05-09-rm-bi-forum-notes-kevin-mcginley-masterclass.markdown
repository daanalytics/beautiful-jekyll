Day I of the Rittman Mead BI Forum 2012 started of with a Masterclass provided by [Kevin McGinley](http://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinmcginley). Het took us on a journey along the Oracle BI Action Framework,Â Oracle Scorecards and Strategy Management, Oracle Mobile, Oracle BI 11g Customizations.

Some notes about the subjects covered:

--

There is a whole world next or behind Oracle BI 11g; **Oracle BI Action Framework**. Not all evenly well documented!! Even more interesting to explore.

--

Consider **OSSM** - Oracle Scorecards and Strategy Management as a 3th (next to reports - BI Publisher and Analysis - Oracle BI Answers) way to deliver data to your end-user.
OSSM provides features Oracle BI Publisher / Answers cannot deliver.
Using OSSM for 'traditional' Oracle BI
It's the new kid on the blog so it needs some more fine tuning and there is a lot (more) to learn.
Probably not so much a technical challenge as it is at the cultural / process side

Mobile Applification
Trends to 33% Mobile BI in 2012
Is **Oracle BI Mobile** a real mobile app or is it just a web GUI presented via a mobile device (iPad / iPod)?
Compared to 3th party tools like [RoamBI](http://www.roambi.com/) / [SurfBI](http://www.surfbi.com/), they tend to have more mobile functionality. Whether the analytical capabilities are better remains to be seen. Both applications (including some demo content) are to be downloaded from Apple Appstore.

**Customization** in Oracle BI 11g at the client-side or the server-side. There is more then one way to skin a cat. Start [here](http://bit.ly/JduRi4).
Customization means backup and document each file and modifications to these file. These way you should be 'safe' in case of an upgrade.

Check [here](http://opencheckbook.itd.state.ma.us/analytics/saw.dll?Dashboard) for an impression of the various customizations you could apply to an Oracle BI 11g application.

More to come
