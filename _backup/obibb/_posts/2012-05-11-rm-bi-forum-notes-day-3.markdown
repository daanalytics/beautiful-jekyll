Day 3 of the Rittman Mead BI Forum is the second of the two core days filled with 1 hour and 10 minute presentations.

A few notes related to the 1 hour presentations. These notes by far do not cover everything that has been presented, but should give you a indication and possibly a starting point for further investigation.
