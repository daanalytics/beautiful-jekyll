I wish you all a Happy and Healthy 2013.

The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2012 annual report for this blog.

[![](http://www.wordpress.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/annual-reports/img/2012-emailteaser.png)](http://obibb.wordpress.com/2012/annual-report/)

Here's an excerpt:


<blockquote>19,000 people fit into the new Barclays Center to see Jay-Z perform. This blog was viewed about **85,000** times in 2012. If it were a concert at the Barclays Center, it would take about 4 sold-out performances for that many people to see it.</blockquote>

As far as I see there will be enough to talk an blog about the coming year. I hope I will find the time and place to do so.
