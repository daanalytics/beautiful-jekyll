Last June I was present at the [nl_OUG Tech Experience 2017](http://blog.daanalytics.nl/2017/05/10/tech-experience-2017-an-inspiring-source-of-oracle-knowledge/). These kind of events are not only interesting because of the networking possibilities. One of the most valuable aspects  is the fact that people are sharing their knowledge. The Oracle community is a very active community so there were two days of intensive knowledge sharing. I wrote two blogpost to give a short impression of the [15th](http://blog.daanalytics.nl/2017/06/16/nl-oug-tech-experience-15-june-2017/) and the [16th](http://blog.daanalytics.nl/2017/06/16/nl-oug-tech-experience-16-june-2017/) of June.

I am active in Oracle related environments since the late '90s. The world back then compared to the world today is completely different. We entered the ["The Fourth Industrial Revolution"](https://www.weforum.org/focus/the-fourth-industrial-revolution). New technologies and different ways of working, collaborating and communicating force us to change the way we act. This means learning new things. Tim Hall is writing a serie of [blogposts](https://oracle-base.com/blog/2017/06/19/learning-new-things-a-series-of-posts/) about learning new things.

Following several presentations and keynotes at the "nl_OUG Tech Experience 2017" proved to me that there is a lot to learn. Even when I was preparing for my own presentation.

When searching for information and talking to several people it turned out that I learned new things along the way. After two days I had enough subjects to start investigating. It is so much that I had not got a clue of where to start. Lot's of things are interesting. I decided to just have a go and see where it leads to.

Blogging gives me the opportunity to store my findings and share it with the rest of the world. I know that at least I will benefit from this.

There are three subjects in general were I want to share my findings. I will share these findings from one central blogpost where I will link to various other posts.



 	
  * [Oracle Business Analytics](http://blog.daanalytics.nl/2017/07/10/exploring-oracle-business-analytics/)

 	
  * Oracle Big Data

 	
  * Not necessarily Oracle focussed but at least related.


When these posts are ready, I will update these links. I hope you will find my findings interesting. Please share your comments.

Thanks for reading.
