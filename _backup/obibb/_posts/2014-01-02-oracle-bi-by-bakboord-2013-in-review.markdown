The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2013 annual report for this blog.

[![](http://www.wordpress.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/annual-reports/img/2012-emailteaser.png)](http://obibb.wordpress.com/2013/annual-report/)

Here's an excerpt:


<blockquote>Madison Square Garden can seat 20,000 people for a concert. This blog was viewed about **64,000** times in 2013. If it were a concert at Madison Square Garden, it would take about 3 sold-out performances for that many people to see it.</blockquote>
