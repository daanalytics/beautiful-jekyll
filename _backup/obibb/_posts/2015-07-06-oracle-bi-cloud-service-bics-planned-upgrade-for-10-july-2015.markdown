As from the 10th of July the Oracle BI Cloud Service environment will be upgraded. Looking forward to the new features and enhancements to the Oracle BI Cloud Service. Find below a list of things we can expect.

**Fresh new look to Oracle BI Cloud Service**


Improved design that’s simple to navigate and easy to use. Includes a brand new Academy to help you get the most out of Oracle BI Cloud Service.


**View your data in a heat matrix**


Use a heat matrix view to see a two-dimensional depiction of data where values are represented by a gradient of colors.


**Visualize geographical data on maps**


Use a map view to display data on a map in several different formats and to interact with the data.


**Manage your data files**


Review, download, and delete the data files you’ve uploaded for analysis. Quickly see whether you’re close to reaching your quota.


**Enhancements to Data Modeler**



	
  * Let Oracle BI Cloud Service recommend fact and dimension tables when you first start building the data model.

	
  * Override the aggregation set for a measure for one or more dimensions.

	
  * Sort attribute values by a different column.

	
  * Define variables that return multiple values.

	
  * Programmatically clear data cached for your model through new REST APIs.

	
  * A copy of your data model saves automatically when you publish changes to the model. This makes it easy to recover to a previous version if something goes wrong.


Enjoy.
