The buzz started a few weeks ago on Twitter. A few guys belonging to the Premier League of the Oracle BI Community are in the course of writing a [book](http://www.packtpub.com/oracle-business-intelligence-enterprise-edition-11g/book) on  Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition 11g.

The authors of the forthcoming book are;



	
  * [Christian Screen](http://www.packtpub.com/authors/profiles/christian-screen)

	
  * [Haroun Khan](http://www.packtpub.com/authors/profiles/haroun-khan)

	
  * [Adrian Ward](http://www.packtpub.com/authors/profiles/adrian-ward)


I am proud for being invited to do some reviewing. Now I know for a fact that these guys have manged to put together a step-by-step guide which should give you enough in-depth knowledge of everything the Oracle BI Suite 11g has to offer you.

The Book and eBook are expected in August 2012. You'd better pre-order now!!
