I attended two Oracle conferences over the last few weeks. There was a [Oracle Technology Conference 2012](http://www.oracle.com/webapps/events/ns/EventsDetail.jsp?p_eventId=142643&src=7295872&src=7295872&Act=228&evite=228) in Brussels and a [Exalytics](http://www.oracle.com/us/solutions/ent-performance-bi/business-intelligence/exalytics-bi-machine/overview/index.html) Launch – Power Premiere in Utrecht. At both these events there was special attention for [Endeca](http://www.oracle.com/us/solutions/ent-performance-bi/endeca-info-discovery-1494658.html?ssSourceSiteId=opn). Oracle Endeca Information Discovery (EID) to be precise. Oracle Endeca is an addition to the already existing Oracle BI Foundation (Oracle BI EE, Scorecarding, Essbase, etc.). The traditional Oracle BI is mainly focused on Structured Data. With the acquisition of Endeca, Oracle added functionality to index and analyse both structured as well as unstructured data. This adds the possibility to come to new insights which you do not have to model upfront.

Triggered by the authors of [Endeca123.com](http://www.endeca123.com) I decided to download Endeca myself and play around with it. The first steps are easy as 1-2-3 and within the hour you can have your first Endeca Sample Application up and running. Just download the [Endeca Quickstart](https://edelivery.oracle.com/EPD/Download/get_form?egroup_aru_number=14534036) from the Oracle Software Delivery Cloud and start playing around.

It will be interesting if and how Oracle will integrate Endeca into their standard offerings. Will Oracle BI 11g replace the dashboarding capabilities? How would you model the unstructured data poart into the Oracle BI Repository? Will Oracle Data Integrator replace the [CloverETL](http://www.cloveretl.com/) tool. Let's see where this is heading.

Cheers.
