A few weeks ago I wrote a [piece](http://blog.daanalytics.nl/2017/07/12/oracle-mobile-analytics/) about Oracle Mobile Analytics. Now a few weeks later I would like to add to this post with some things and findings I ran into over the last couple of weeks. I have been looking at the new Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) offering. This post is based on how Oracle Mobile Analytics relates to OAC.

In OAC there are various options for Mobile Analytics. First you can go to the mobile devices browser. Just startup the url in the browser. No need to download a mobile app. Using a mobile browser does come with some  issues / challenges. There are differences between the different browsers. Not all content on all browsers is rendered (the same). Also you cannot make use of [mobile touch gestures](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E52471_01/bi.1111/e52132/GUID-F3801F48-A676-40A2-8F73-D01A25738CC2.htm#BIEMO-GUID-F3801F48-A676-40A2-8F73-D01A25738CC2) like; touch, tap, double-tap, drag, pinch, swipe, zoom.

Two other options are Oracle Mobile HD (Consume the dashboards and reports via an app) and Synopsis (Free - offline - Data Analysis on the go).  The latter; Synopsis is not necessarily related to OAC. One would use Synopsis to analyse offline datasources. These might be OAC extracts, but there is no direct connection.

Oracle Synopsis 2.0 now available on Android devices. Picture yourself using your eyes as a data-set. Check out the Lens feature for free.

Last but not least Oracle Day by Day (BI Ask) - "This time it's personal".


<blockquote>With Oracle Day By Day, Oracle has made a fresh start on mobile, focusing on users' information needs rather than on simple BI delivery. - The Forrester Wave™</blockquote>


The idea behind Oracle Day by Day (DxD) is to deliver personalised content (what) to the user when and where he/she wants it. It will know who a user communicates with. Eventually DxD will understand why a user is interested in certain content. Based on an users interactions with the app, DxD will learn how to integrate Analytics into the users (professional) live instead of the other way around. Oracle Day by Day is all about providing a platform where the user is not having to actively request information (i.e. issue queries), but instead receive delivered, personalised reports on their mobile or tablet as and when they need it.

It will be nice to further explore the capabilities of Oracle Day by Day. I will try to cover that in another post.

So there are three different applications in the Oracle Mobile Analytics Landscape when it comes to Oracle OAC. What are the major differences between these three?
