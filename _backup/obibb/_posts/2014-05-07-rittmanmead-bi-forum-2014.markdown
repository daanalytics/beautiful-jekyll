[![RittmanMead BI Forum 2014](http://obibb.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/bf8db-bi-forum-680x338-no-logo.png)](http://www.rittmanmead.com/2014/04/final-timetable-and-agenda-for-the-brighton-and-atlanta-bi-forums-may-2014/)



Today the 6th (my 5th) RittmanMead BI Forum takes off in Brighton. As usual the guys at RittmanMead have been able to put together a variety of sessions (Presentations, TED session, Keynotes, Debate) around OBIEE through to Oracle Endeca, Oracle Data Integrator and Oracle Essbase and In-Memory Analytics Databases.

For me the RittmanMead BI Forum is an opportunity to meet with the Premier League in Oracle BI&DW.

Check the RittmanMead website for the [agenda](http://www.rittmanmead.com/2014/04/final-timetable-and-agenda-for-the-brighton-and-atlanta-bi-forums-may-2014/) and [more details](http://www.rittmanmead.com/2014/04/more-details-on-the-lars-george-cloudera-hadoop-masterclass-rm-bi-forum-2014-brighton-atlanta/) on the Lars George Cloudera Hadoop Masterclass – RM BI Forum 2014, Brighton & Atlanta

I will try to keep up a diary of the following three days.
