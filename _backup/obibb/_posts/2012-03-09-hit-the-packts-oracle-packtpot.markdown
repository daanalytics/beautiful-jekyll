I have been doing some reviewing in the past for [Packt Publishing](http://obibb.wordpress.com/2010/11/19/review-oracle-siebel-crm-8-installation-and-management/). They have informed me about the fact that Packt is running a campaign for Oracle books in March.

**Check out [Packt's Oracle Packtpot](http://bit.ly/y4lshw): Exciting discounts on Oracle books/e-books throughout March2012! **
