![](https://obibb.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/logo-oracle-data-visualization.png?w=300)Last month Oracle released a new version of [Oracle Data Visualization V3.0](https://www.oracle.com/solutions/business-analytics/data-visualization.html). In this upgraded version you can expect some new functionality regarding:



 	
  * Connections to data sources & data preparation,

 	
  * Enhanced data flow

 	
  * Intuitive data visualization process setup & formatting

 	
  * Comprehensive system management toolset


Check out the presentation of [Philippe Lions](https://twitter.com/philippe_lions?lang=en) below where he gives a tour of the Oracle Data Visualization V3.0 new features.

[Boris Dahav](http://obieeil.blogspot.nl/2017/06/data-visualization-desktop-3.html) did an excellent job outlining the new features. Also Francesco Tisiot has put his thoughts about V3 into a [blog](https://www.rittmanmead.com/blog/2017/07/oracle-data-visualization-desktop-v3-new-features/).

You can also directly have a look at this Youtube video below.

If you want to have a more detailed look (also mentioned in [Boris Dahav](http://obieeil.blogspot.nl/2017/06/data-visualization-desktop-3.html) blogpost), please check out these Oracle PM video [playlist](https://t.co/Z6tAjTupb0).

The guys over at Vlamis put together an interesting [webcast](http://www.vlamis.com/dvd-30-webinar) outlining and showcasing some of the new V3 features.

The opportunities within Oracle Data Visualization are expanding and improving. Sometimes it is just too much to catch up with. Fortunately there is the [Oracle Analytics Store](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/OracleAnalyticStore/index.html). Here you can find different examples of the capabilities of Oracle Data Visualization. Some are create by Oracle PM and some by Oracle Partners. These examples can be downloaded and imported into your own environment. You should really check this out.

Also nice to see is the Oracle Data Visualization [Interactive Demo](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/assets/data-visualization/index.html).

This post is written as part of my [Exploring Oracle Business Analytics](http://blog.daanalytics.nl/2017/07/10/exploring-oracle-business-analytics/) series.

Thanks for reading.
