For me personally, the last few months were dominated by my switch of employer. For the past seven years I have worked for [Scamander Solutions](http://www.scamander.com) (The Data Liberation Company). Since 1 may 2011 I have joined [Ebicus](http://www.ebicus.com) (Excellence in Oracle/Siebel BI & CRM ), to help expanding the Oracle BI Practice.

I hope I will be able to contribute some new  Oracle BI (Applications) content to the community the coming months. Lucky enough for me Oracle decided to [release](http://obibb.wordpress.com/2011/05/06/oracle-bi-11g-11-1-1-5-ready-to-explore/) a new version of their Oracle BI Suite. There should be enough to explore.

Next to that, I will be joining the [Rittman Mead BI Forum 2011](http://www.rittmanmead.com/biforum2011/). I have attended the forum [last year](http://obibb.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/rittmanmead-bi-forum-2010-wrap-up/), so I am confident this will become a very interesting event again. My advice is the same as last year; Keep an eye out for blogs from some of the attendees and Twitter posts (hashtag [#biforum](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23biforum)). I will try to post some of my notes as well.
