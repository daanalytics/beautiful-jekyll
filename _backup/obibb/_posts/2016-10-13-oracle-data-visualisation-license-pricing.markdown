One of Oracle's focus points within the Oracle Business Analytics Suite is Oracle Data Visualisation. The Oracle Business Analytics Strategy is based on three pillars. One of these pillars is; "See the Signals", Visual Analytics in every solution.

It doesn't matter whether you run Oracle Business Analytics in the Cloud or On-Prem, Stand-alone or integrated in the platform, Oracle Data Visualisation is available.

A few months ago you could have been able to read a [blogpost](https://blogs.oracle.com/emeapartnerbiepm/entry/oracle_data_visualisation_license_pricing) about Oracle Data Visualisation License Pricing. One of the products within the Oracle Data Visualisation offering is the Oracle Data Visualisation Desktop ([DVD](https://blogs.oracle.com/emeapartnerbiepm/entry/new_in_may_2016_data)).

Is it possible to buy only DVD?

We had a discussion about this question in the [#obihackers](http://rmoff.net/2016/03/03/obihackers-irc-channel/) IRC channel. The answer to the question wasn't as easy as the question itself or maybe we made it more difficult then necessary. Basically it comes down to the following:

You cannot buy “only DVD”. A customer buys Oracle Oracle Data Visualisation (DV) License. The fee is $1250 per named user (minimum lowered to 1). For this the customer gets both  (1) the ability to use DV with OBI 12c if they have it and (2) the ability to use DVD. So if the customer does not have OBI 12c then they effectively do buy “only DVD”.

Why would you buy “only DVD”? That's the question. It might be better to start with a DVCS subscription and start from there.

If you want to know more about the Oracle Data Visualisation offering, the following resources (thanks to Mike Hallett from Oracle) will be helpful:
