One of my clients wanted to change to color fromat of the grand-total columns in a Pivot-view. The format of values of the grand-total should match the format of the label of the grand-total. I used to go to one of John’s blogposts; [OBIEE views.css color cheat sheet](http://obiee101.blogspot.com/2009/05/obiee-viewscss-color-cheat-sheet.html). One of my colleagues pointed me to the color picker functionality in [Paint.Net](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html)[](http://obibb.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/pn-color.png), although there are probably more programs with such functionality.

How does it work? Picture the following pivot;

Make a screenshot of this pivot and open it in Paint.Net. Open de colors-window (F8)

Click on the color-picker in the tools-window.

Use the color-picker to select the color you want to use. In this case I had to click on the grand-total column. Now when you check the colors-window, you get exactly the color codes you have to use to change the format of the grand-total values.

Very easy to use, but yet very handy.
