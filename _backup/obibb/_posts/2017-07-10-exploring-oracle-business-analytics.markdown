In the blogpost about ["Gathering new Knowledge"](http://blog.daanalytics.nl/2017/07/07/gathering-new-knowledge/) I decided to investigate a few different areas of the Oracle atmosphere. Oracle Business Analytics was one of them. In a series of different blogposts I will cover different parts of the Oracle Business Analytics  product suite. At the end of this post there will be a list of different links to the blogposts I will be sharing.

I will begin with a post I created earlier. This is because of the importance of the subject. One crucial element in Oracle Analytics is the Oracle BI Server. Thanks to [Christian Berg](https://twitter.com/nephentur?lang=en), we were able to go to the [Core of Oracle Analytics](http://blog.daanalytics.nl/2017/06/22/going-to-the-core-of-oracle-analytics/).

Last month Oracle released a new version of [Oracle Data Visualization V3.0](http://wp.me/pVzHx-yG). In this upgraded version you can expect some new functionality regarding:



	
  * connections to data sources & data preparation,

	
  * enhanced data flow

	
  * intuitive data visualization process setup & formatting

	
  * comprehensive system management toolset


When the posts are ready, I will post the links below. I hope you will find my findings interesting. Please share your comments.

This post is written as part of my [Gathering new Knowledge](http://blog.daanalytics.nl/2017/07/07/gathering-new-knowledge/) series.

Thanks for reading.
