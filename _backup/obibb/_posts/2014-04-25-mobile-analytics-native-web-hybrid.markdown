Last week I had a discussion with my colleagues over [@Scamander](http://www.scamander.com) during one of our Tech Sessions. The subject was [(Oracle) Mobile Analytics](http://www.oracle.com/us/solutions/business-analytics/business-intelligence/mobile/overview/index.html), which is one of the Big Data and Analytics [Top Ten Trends for 2014](http://obibb.wordpress.com/2014/04/03/big-data-and-analytics-top-ten-trends-for-2014/). During the discussion we were discussing the difference between Native Apps and Web Apps and the necessity of a Native App when you can built / use  a Web App. Because of a time constraint we were not able to finish our discussion.

My colleague; [Daoud Urdu](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/daoed-urdu/22/651/79) pointed me to the following presentation; '[HTML5 and the Journey to the Modern and Mobile Web](http://gartnerevent.com/SocVideo)'. This gives some valuable background to Mobile Application Development.
