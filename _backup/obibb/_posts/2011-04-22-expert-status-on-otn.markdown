[Kranthi K](http://in.linkedin.com/pub/kranthi-k/14/293/706) has been kind enough to create a special [OTN Forum item ](http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=2211014&tstart=0)because of the fact I have reached the 'Expert'-level status. Thanks Kranthi for doing this. It's nice to see when people are _appreciating the things you do._

Unfortunately I had to change my email-address lately. I thought that wouldn't be a problem. Wrong!! When you change your email-address, Oracle creates a new profile for you. So my old 'Expert'-profile looks like this:

I used to be a person, but I am a number now.............

As from now on I have a second profile. I am a name again.......but a 'Newbie'.

Hopefully those two profiles can be merged. Otherwise I will have a long way to go, to reach the 'Expert'-level status again. I might be the first one reaching this level twice.
