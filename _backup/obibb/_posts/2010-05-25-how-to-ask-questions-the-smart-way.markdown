 I am a frequent visitor of the [ Oracle BI EE Forum](http://forums.oracle.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=378&start=0). Either to share or to gain knowledge. Sometimes I am supprised by the way people ask questions. It is a misconception to think people can read one and others minds.

An excellent example of one of those [questions](http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=1076573) has been posted last week.

I will not be pointing fingers. [John](http://obiee101.blogspot.com/) gave his reaction in a very decent way. What I do want to make clear is that proper asked questions as well as correct and clear answers will add value to a forum. It takes some time to answer questions. Some people take the effort to write blog posts about the subjects. I think we could make each other's lives a lot easier if we take the time to give enough input at front and some feedback afterwards.

Please take note of the following and try to keep the forum valuable as it is most of the times.
