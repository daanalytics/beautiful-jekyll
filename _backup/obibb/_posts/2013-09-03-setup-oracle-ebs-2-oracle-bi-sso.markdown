I made several blogposts in the past. That's why it could be useful to collect these posts into one [document](http://www.slideshare.net/makumbe/setup-oracle-ebs-2-oracle-bi?utm_source=slideshow02&utm_medium=ssemail&utm_campaign=iupload_share_slideshow). This document covers all the steps needed to integrate Oracle eBS (R12) and Oracle BI (11g) with each other. SSO might be a little bit confusing. In this case itâ€™s meant that you can log into Oracle BI via Oracle eBS without having to log in again and while maintaining context.
