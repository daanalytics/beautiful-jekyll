Today I started blogging. Yet another blog about Oracle BI related subjects. Working with OBIEE is one of my day to day activities. OBIBB (Oracle BI By Bakboord) will be my platform to share my experiences.  

I will try to express my views on all sorts of subjects related to Oracle and Oracle Business Intelligence. My first posts will cover the Rittman Mead forum ([http://www.rittmanmead.com/biforum2010/](http://www.rittmanmead.com/biforum2010/)) , which I will attend later this week
