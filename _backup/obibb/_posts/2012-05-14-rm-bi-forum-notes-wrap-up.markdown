Last week I have tried to give you an impression about the Rittman Mead BI Forum 2012. They managed to provide us with a four day program packed with all things related to Oracle BI. Two core days with various presentations. Various in subject; Oracle BI, agile, Fusion Apps, Endeca, etc., etc. But also various in style; Keynotes, one hour presentations and 10-minute (TED/Ignite) presentations. Next to that the possibility of a Masterclass by Kevin McGinley and a NDA session by Oracle.
I was one of the lucky few, who was able to join all four days. Four days, packed with information and a basis for a lot of inspiration. Where to start!?

The Rittman Mead BI Forum is a good place to network and to exchange ideas. It was good to see a lot of known faces again. On top of that I have met some 'new' people also.

A big thank you to Mark Rittman, Jon Mead and their crew. Also a big thanks to Oracle for joining and for being so open about the Oracle BI developments and their visions and roadmaps. Thanks all for joining and sharing. That's what makes the Rittman Mead BI Forum such a great event to be at. Hope to see everyone next year.

Tommorow the US version of the Rittman Mead BI Forum will start. If you would like to stay informed, you should check the [Tweetchat](http://t.co/laoDgE3a).

Stay on the lookout for the pdf's which will probably placed on the Rittman Mead website. There will definitely be some good stuff to have a look at!!
