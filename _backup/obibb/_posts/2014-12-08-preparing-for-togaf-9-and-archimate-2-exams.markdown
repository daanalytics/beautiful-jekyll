Last week I posted a [blog](http://obibb.wordpress.com/2014/12/03/togaf-9-and-archimate-2-certified/) that I had passed my TOGAF 9 and ArchiMate 2 Certification Exams. Find below the two presentations I made for myself to help me study. It's certainly not enough information to pass both exams, but it might help to get the bigger picture.


### TOGAF 9

### ArchiMate 2

I hope these presentations can serve as a little bit of help.

Good luck.
