Today the 5th (my 4th) RittmanMead BI Forum takes off in Brighton. As usual the guys at RittmanMead have been able to put together a variety of sessions (Presentations, TED session, Keynotes, Debate) around Oracle BI (Applications), Oracle Endeca, Oracle Data Integrator and Oracle Essbase.

For me theÂ RittmanMead BI Forum is an opportunity to meet with the Premier League in Oracle BI.

Check the RittmanMead website for the [agenda](http://www.rittmanmead.com/2013/05/previewing-the-brighton-bi-forum-2013/) and a [preview](http://www.rittmanmead.com/2013/05/previewing-the-bi-forum-2013-data-integration-masterclass/) of the Data Integration Masterclass.

I will try to keep up a diary of the following three days.

Check back here to stay posted.
