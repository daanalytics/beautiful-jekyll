Tension rises. One week to go till the commercial launch of the 11g release of Oracle BI EE. There is no specific launch-event planned in Holland. Instead Oracle Netherlands has organized a local variant with a live video-stream with London.

In London there will be a specific breakout session for existing Oracle Partners, at 3.00 pm after the main event, to learn how to gain the inside track to getting the most out of this new OBI 11_g_ release as fast as possible.

The material from this breakout will be posted on the [EMEA BI/EPM partner community Portal](http://www.oracle.com/partners/secure/engage-with-oracle/026361) for you to access after the event.

For those of you who are not able to attend physically, there will be a Â [Oracle Business Intelligence 11g Launch Webcast](http://www.oracle.com/webapps/events/EventsDetail.jsp?p_eventId=118807&src=7011193&src=7011193&Act=127)

Hopefully afterwards we all could say it was worth all these years of waiting.

Definitely more to come.
