Tomorrow the second RittmanMead BI Forum will start ([http://www.rittmanmead.com/2010/05/18/the-day-before-the-bi-forum-2010/](http://www.rittmanmead.com/2010/05/18/the-day-before-the-bi-forum-2010/)). I think it will be informative and fun as well. If you weren't lucky enough to make it this year, you could still stay informed.

As Mark says, keep an eye out for blogs from some of the attendees andÂ Twitter posts (hashtag [#biforum](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23biforum)). I will try to post some notes the following days.
