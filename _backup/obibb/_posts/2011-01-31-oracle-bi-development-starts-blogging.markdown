Yesterday [Mark Rittman](http://twitter.com/markrittman) notified the (Twitter-) world about a new Oracle BI Blog. Oracle BI Development started a [weblog](http://blogs.oracle.com/bifoundation/). This blog will cover Best Practices, Tips and Tricks about the Oracle BI Foundation. It think it will become a great resource for all of you active in the Oracle BI Foundation field.

The first post about the concept of and modelling in the CEIM (Common Enterprise Information Model) looks very promising.

I'll advise you to bookmark this site. I already did!
