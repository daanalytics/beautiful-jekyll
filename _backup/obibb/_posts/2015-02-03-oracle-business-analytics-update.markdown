Last week I visited the Oracle Business Analytics Partner Update at [Oracle NL](https://twitter.com/oracle_nl) in Utrecht, the Netherlands. The NL (Pre-) Sales gave us an update of the Oracle Analytics Roadmap. There is a lot of movement in the world of Oracle Analytics. I have written about the publications during [Oracle Open World 2014](https://obibb.wordpress.com/2014/10/10/oracle-openworld-2014-is-over-whats-next/). When we look back at 2014; "[Year in Review – Oracle Business Analytics in 2014](https://blogs.oracle.com/bi_pulse/entry/year_in_review_oracle_business1)", we can see that there are a few subjects key; Big Data, Cloud.


### Oracle Business Analytics Strategy


The Oracle Business Analytics Strategy can be captured in one picture.

The Oracle Business Analytics Strategy consists of Six Design Goals.
