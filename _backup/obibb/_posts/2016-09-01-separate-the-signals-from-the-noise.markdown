Earlier this year I wrote two blogposts about the publication of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence and Analytic Platforms.



	
  * [So Oracle did not make it to the Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence and Analytics Platforms?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/so-oracle-did-make-magic-quadrant-business-analytics-daan-bakboord?trk=mp-author-card)

	
  * [BI & Analytics Market - Agile BI and / or Enterprise Reporting?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bi-analytics-market-agile-enterprise-reporting-daan-bakboord?trk=mp-author-card)


Without choosing sides between Gartner or Oracle, it is clear that the landscape of analytics (and the tools and techniques to support analytics) is changing.

Today I viewed a webcast where both Rita Sallam (Research Vice President Business Analytics and Data Sciences @ Gartner) and Rich Clayton (Vice President Business Analytics @ Oracle) express their views on:

	
  * The current and future state of the BI/Analytics market

	
  * Oracle's answer to the evolution of this market

	
  * Some of the types of Analytics use cases

	
  * How to see the signals in your data and discover the answers


Find the link to the webcast below:

Quistor believes in Oracle's strategy when it comes to Business Intelligence and Analytics. If necessary or desired, we would be happy to put things in context.
