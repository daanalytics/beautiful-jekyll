**Big Data - Hype or Future**

This is a very difficult discussion. First of all, what is the definition of Big Data? I liked the 'definition' of [Peter Scott](http://www.rittmanmead.com/author/peter-scott/); If you do not care about a single row, you refer to Big Data. Sounds plausible. Is Big Data about tools (Hadoop vs. Oracle Database)? Is Big Data about the difference between structured and unstructured data? In a way all data can be referred to as structured. There is a whole new source of (Social) Data which didn't exist before. Is that Big Data?

All in all one essential question is; what are you going to do with the data? Just collecting data, because everybody does it would be useless.

Making decisions on data which is only for 95% correct is whole new way of thinking as opposed to traditional (Financial) DWH-systems. I guess (almost) everybody agreed on that.
