[](http://obibb.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/o_certified-specialist_clr.gif)As of today it's official. I am an 'Oracle Fusion Middleware 11g Business Intelligence Foundation Certified Implementation Specialist'. A few weeks ago I managed to pass the; 'Oracle Business Intelligence Foundation Certified Implementation Specialist'-exams ([1Z0-526](http://www.oracle.com/partners/en/knowledge-zone/database/oracle-epm-and-bi/obi-exam-168632.html)).

According to my current Oracle Certification Status, I am now;

A lot of questions arise about preperation for this exam. If you have experience with Oracle BI EE, which you should have when you want to call your self a Certified Implementation Specialist, you should be able to answer all kinds of questions related to Oracle BI EE. Some more details could be found [here](http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=41&p_exam_id=1Z0_526). You should be familiar with all mentioned aspects.

So my conclusion is; If you have experience with Oracle BI EE it should not be any problem to pass the exam.
