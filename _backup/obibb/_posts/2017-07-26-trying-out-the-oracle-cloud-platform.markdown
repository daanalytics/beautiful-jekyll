One of the great things of working with Oracle is the possibility to try things out.........., for free. Yes, some things at Oracle are indeed free ðŸ˜ƒ!! There are various places where you can download Oracle (related) software / scripts / examples / etc., so you can try things out.




You should create an account on OTN (Oracle Technology Network) and [download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/downloads/index.html)Â the software you want to try out. Also on OTN, you can find pre-built [Virtual Box Appliances](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/developer-vm/index.html), so you can start trying out software without the hassle of installing it yourself. Check out various examples and scripts for Oracle in general [here](https://github.com/oracle)Â or for Oracle Analytics in specific in the Oracle Analytics [Store](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/OracleAnalyticStore/index.html). This is just a brief example of all Oracle related info you could find online.




There is a large Oracle Community (both online on e.g. Twitter, the [Oracle Forums](https://community.oracle.com/welcome)Â or good old [IRC](https://rmoff.net/2016/03/03/obihackers-irc-channel/) as well as offline e.g. at the various [User Conferences](http://www.jk-consult.nl/oracle-usergroup-conferences/)) where you can exchange your knowledge on all different topics in the Oracle Red Stack.




The last few years Oracle is making the move to the Cloud. Although the platform in the C[![](https://obibb.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/oraclecloudplatformlogo.png?w=300)](http://cloud.oracle.com)loud is the same as On-Premise, people still want to try things out. Fortunately Oracle offers the opportunity to try things out in the Cloud. Navigate to the Oracle Cloud [Trial Page](https://cloud.oracle.com/tryit).





<blockquote>

Oracle sends various announcements out into the public to try out their Oracle Cloud Platform.




"Try our [#**OracleCloud**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OracleCloud?src=hash) Platform. You can get $300 in free credit to make the most of all the features. See how: [http://ora.cl/VB0M0](https://t.co/4nQYtMNmGb)"




This is great or at least it sounds great. As part of my [Gathering new Knowledge](http://blog.daanalytics.nl/2017/07/07/gathering-new-knowledge/)Â experience, I tried out the [Data Lake Self Guided Tutorial](https://blogs.oracle.com/emeapartnerbiepm/data-lake-self-guided-tutorials-for-partners). Therefor IÂ signed up for an Oracle Cloud Trial, where I created an Object Storage Instance, and a Big Data Cloud Service - Compute Edition (BDCS-CE) Instance. It was nice to see some of the possibilities and tried things out.




Unfortunately after 30 days my trial (not my credits!) was over. I received several mails that my trial period was extended and therefor my services have been terminated. The only option was to [convert](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/get-started/subscriptions-cloud/csgsg/converting-your-free-oracle-cloud-promotion.html) my Free Oracle Cloud subscription.




![](https://obibb.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/endedfreecloudtrials.png?w=300)I also tried to setup a new environment. With no succes unfortunately. It looks like I need a new account and probably a new credit card to make this work.











I hope Oracle will come up with another solution to keep the Oracle (Cloud) Community as active and alive as the Oracle On-Premise Community.




Thanks for reading.
