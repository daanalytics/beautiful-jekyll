Sometimes when working on a specific challenge which you have worked on many times before, you wished you had some kind of repository with all sorts of scripts and docs. This would make your life a whole lot easier. Lately I started working with [GitHub](http://www.github.com). There are probably other possibilities as well, but for now GitHub is it for me.

A few days ago I wrote a [blogpost](http://obibb.wordpress.com/2013/05/22/integrating-oracle-ebs-and-oracle-bi-11g-application-roles/) about integrating Oracle eBS Responsibility Profiles and Oracle BI 11g Application roles. I decided to upload the scripts within this post into a Oracle BI By Bakboord repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/obibb/integrate_obi_and_ebs/blob/master/BIApplicationRole-eBS-Profile.sql).

I will try to upload new scripts after this one.

Feel free to comment.
