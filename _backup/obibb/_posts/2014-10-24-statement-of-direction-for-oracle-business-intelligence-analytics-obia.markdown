Last week Oracle released a [Statement of Direction](https://blogs.oracle.com/proactivesupportEPM/entry/statement_of_direction_oracle_business) (SOD) for Oracle Business Intelligence Analytics (OBIA). The message from Oracle to their Customers is clear; Move away from OBIA 7.9.6.x and move to OBIA 11g, either in the Cloud or On Premise.

Let us have a look what the actual message is. Find below a picture would find in a lot of the current Oracle presentations regarding Oracle Business Analytics. It's shows you Oracle's Business Analytics Strategy

[![Oracle Business Analytics Strategy - 2014](https://obibb.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/oracle-business-analytics-strategy-20141.png?w=660)](https://obibb.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/oracle-business-analytics-strategy-20141.png)Oracle delivers 'Any Data' via a 'Full Suite of Analytic Tools', Pre-Configured in 'Packaged Analytic Applications', Engineered together on Exalytics (one of Oracle's 'Engineered Systems')

Oracle delivers [Packaged Analytic Applications](http://www.oracle.com/us/solutions/business-analytics/analytic-applications/business-role/overview/index.html) in roughly two different flavors:



	
  * Informatica 7.9.6.x

	
  * ODI 11g


There will be no more upgrades on Oracle BIA 7.9.6.x (Informatica release). A few months ago there was a rumor that there would come an Oracle BIA 11g (Informatica release). **This is not going to happen**.


#### What are the options?


If you read the SOD for OBIA, existing Oracle BIA 7.9.6.x-Customers are left with three options:



	
  1. Remain on Oracle BIA 7.9.6.x

	
  2. Move to ODI 11g

	
    * New separate instance

	
    * Migrate to a new instance




	
  3. Move to the Cloud




#### Remain on Oracle BIA 7.9.6.x
