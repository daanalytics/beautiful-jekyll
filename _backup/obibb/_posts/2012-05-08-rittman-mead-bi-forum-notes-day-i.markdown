Today the fourth Rittman Mead BI Forum has started. Unfortunately I wasn't able to join from the beginning because of an accident somewhere along the (rail)road to [Brighton](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=50.842941,-0.131312&spn=0.1,0.1&q=50.842941,-0.131312 (Brighton)&t=h).

The coming days will be full of all things related to the Oracle BI Stack. Today has started with a Orcle BI 11g Masterclass provided by Kevin McGinley. Tonight Oracle wil joins us for a keynote. The next two days will be packed with all kinds of presentations. Friday the forum will end with a  BI Developer (NDA) session about the Oracle BI Developments. Check the full schedule on the Rittman Mead [website](http://ht.ly/9x5vR).

I will try to take notes througout the following days. So please check back to stay connected. You could also follow [#biforum](http://tweetchat.com/room/biforum) on Tweetchat.com to get real-time updates.
