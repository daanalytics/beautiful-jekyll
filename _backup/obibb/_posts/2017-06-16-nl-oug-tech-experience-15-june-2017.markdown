Today the first day of the nl-OUG Tech Experience took place in 'De Rijtuigenloods'. De Dutch Oracle User Group has prepared an interesting and varied program with different speakers from various countries covering almost the complete Oracle RedStack.

But first Chairman Robin Buitenhuis kicked of the [#OGhTech17](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OGhTech17?src=hash) and announced the name change of the OGh. From now on it will be nl.OUG!

After Robin's introduction, Maria Colgan from Oracle took the stand. She covered the struggle between developers & dba's while developing applications. With the (new) Oracle 12c database there is less reason to argue. Here presentation covered subjects like JSON, REST and Docker. In the end Maria could conclude that the Oracle 12c database is the 'Universal Peace Maker'. Check some more [here](https://sqlmaria.com/2017/01/16/building-a-simple-node-js-application-with-oracle/), to get an impression about some of things Maria showed.

Maria must have had the best term of the day by using; 'Sesame Street SQL' which refers to some easy lines of SQL code.

The Experience continued with the different parallel sessions. As one of the [SIG-Leads](https://www.ogh.nl/sig/biwa/) of the OGh I had the privilege to be part of the BIWA-track (Business Analytics & Data Integration). Today there were five different parallel tracks.

**"Is Oracle the best Language for Statistics."** - Brendan Tierney

Oracle comes with over 300+ statistical functions. These statistical functions are available in all version of the Database. When people are performing statistical analytics it's always about Excel and R. When doing statistical analysis in the database, there is no need to extract any data onto client machines. It would also eliminate the possible data security issues with using Excel, R or any other tools.

**"OBIEE DevOps with Containers: How and Why?"** - Gianni Ceresa

Business Analytics development processes should be flexible and agile. Oracle BI is not that flexible and agile by default. A DevOps strategy can be implemented with the help of Docker containers, version control software (e.g. Git) and continuous integration (GitLab) tooling.

**"Running R in your Oracle Database using Oracle R Entreprise"** - Brendan Tierney

After Brendan's first presentation one could think there is no need using R. One can do it all with Oracle Database statistical functions. In this presentation we got an introduction into Oracle R Enterprise. Combining the power of R with the in-database Data Mining / Advanced Analytics capabilities.

**"Data Modeling, BI Modeling and-or Data Blending & Wrangling. What should I do?"** - Hasso Schaap

In Analytics it's all about data. There are various ways to use this data. If you choose to use it directly you can just blend and wrangle the data in your self-service tool. In some cases it might be better to prepare, govern and secure the data. There will be a need to model the data, either upfront (Conceptual, Logical and Physical) or in the Business Analytics Tool.

**"EDQ, OGG and ODI over Exadata in the Cloud for Perfection"** - Gurcan Orhan

The BIWA track concluded this day with a taste of pizza as a metaphor of the various Oracle Data Integration tools (EDQ - Enterprise Data Quality, OGG - Oracle Golden Gate and ODI - Oracle Data Integrator) assembled on the Oracle Exadata Machine. Hardware and Software integrated together both On-Premise as well as in the Cloud.

All in all a very interesting day and (hopefully) a start of a new tradition in Oracle Redstack knowledge exchange in the Netherlands.
