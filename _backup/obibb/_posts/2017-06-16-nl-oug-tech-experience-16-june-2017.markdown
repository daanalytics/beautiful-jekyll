Today the second day of the nl.OUG Tech Experience took place in 'De Rijtuigenloods'. After a really interesting first day it was a real challenge to be at least as good as the day before on day 2. Also for this day the Dutch Oracle User Group has prepared an interesting and varied program. It is nice to see that there was a mix of people which represented the Oracle Community. There where ACE's and non-ACE's, men and also women, veteran speakers and relatively newbies (including myself), young and old, Dutchies and foreigners. All in all a great mixture of people with all the same goal; exchanging knowledge, meeting (new) people and having a lot of fun.

Duncan Mills (Oracle) kicked off the day explaining how he loves instead of fears the (Oracle) Cloud.

One of the things Duncan has learned in his long impressive career is to be pragmatic. You should make your life as easy as possible. The Cloud offers various tools to support this. In the end the Cloud is a 'Force Multiplier' for developers

After the keynote the Experience continued with the different parallel sessions. Also today, one of the [SIG-Leads](https://www.ogh.nl/sig/biwa/) of the nl.OUG, I had the privilege to be part of the BIWA-track (Business Analytics & Data Integration). Today we had four different parallel tracks.

**"Migration steps from OWB to ODI"** - Gurcan Orhan

Oracle Data Integrator (ODI) is Oracle's flagship product when it comes to Data Integration (ETL / E-LT). Officials Oracle Warehouse Builder (OWB) does not exist anymore. Still lot's of company's are using OWB. Migrating from OWB to ODI is not that easy by default. Gurcan explained which migration steps could make this process a bit easier.

**"Introduction in Big Data Cloud Service and Use case"** - Marco Klaassens & Daan Bakboord

When you talk about Big Data and the Cloud, Oracle might not be the first supplier people think about. Still Oracle is making serious progression when it comes to the various Cloud products. With an introduction into the Oracle Big Data Cloud Services, all the products could be placed into the context of the Oracle Information Management Reference Architecture. These architectures always make more sense when explained by a real use case.

**"A Day in the Life of an Oracle Analytics Query" **- Christian Berg

When Christian Berg takes the stand you always know his message is supported by sarcasm, fun and beer. It does not matter which product you use in the Oracle Analytics stack, they are all based on the same core. With Oracle Analytics you don't write a query (just use Oracle SQL Developer for that. Easier and cheaper). Oracle Analytics generates a query based on the metadata you provide. Therefore it is essential to understand how a query is constructed.

Of course Christian had one of the best one-liners of the day; "Oracle BI is just Lego for adults". Different components fit together to make e.g. the perfect query. If one component does not fit, you don't get a saw to make the component fit, you try another one which is made to fit in that place.

**"Collaboration on analystics in the Oracle Business Intelligence and Data Visualization Cloud Service"** - Hasso Schaap

There are several reasons to collaborate on Analytics. Sharing Insights and Story telling are just two examples. Oracle Analytics offers various options to collaborate. Hasso made some reusables. Get into contact with him and start collaborating.

At the end of two really great days, Lucas Jellema wrapped up the experience. With a few salutes, to the board of the nl.OUG for being so brave to host this event, to the audience for joining the conference and to the speakers who were well prepared and willing to share their experiences.

Special thanks to the sponsors.
