![](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAwdAAAAJDIwOWFhNjAzLWQ3OTItNGFlZS05YjY2LTQ2MzZhZDkwZGVhYQ.png)Last Friday I received confirmation that my papers for next [UKOUG Tech17](http://www.tech17.ukoug.org/) in December are accepted. I will be talking about Oracle (Big) Data (Warehousing). The presentations will cover different aspects of the Oracle Data Management ecosystem.

Presenting at the [UKOUG Tech17](http://www.tech17.ukoug.org/) will be a challenge, but I am really looking forward to it. It will give the opportunity put myself and my employer [Quistor](https://www.quistor.com/business-analytics/) on the map. Quistor is always present at the [UKOUG JD Edwards](http://www.jde17.ukoug.org/) Conference & Exhibition. Next to our JD Edwards activities, Quistor is also active in the Business Analytics and Big Data market. Therefor it is great that we are offered the opportunity to be part of the [UKOUG Tech17](http://www.tech17.ukoug.org/).

I am expecting a great lineup in the Business Analytics track. It will be great to meet 'old' and new friends. There will also be an offline presence of the [#obihackers](https://rmoff.net/2016/03/03/obihackers-irc-channel/) IRC channel. Finally a chance to meet people in real-life instead of from behind the keyboard.

See you all next December 2017.
