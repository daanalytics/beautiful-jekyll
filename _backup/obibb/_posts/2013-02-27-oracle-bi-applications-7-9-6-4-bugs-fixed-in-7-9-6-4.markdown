Last january Oracle announced the [release](http://obibb.wordpress.com/2013/01/08/oracle-business-intelligence-applications-7-9-6-4-ga-on-otn/) of a new Oracle BI Applications version; OBIA 7.9.6.4. In the announcement Oracle mentioned the fact that they applied 122 Bugfixes to this release. Unfortunately no one at Oracle seemed to be able to tell which Bugfixes.

Thanks to [Ahmad Bilal](http://oracleebusinesssuite.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/oracle-bi-applications-obia-7-9-6-4-released/) for pointing me into the right direction. Have a look at the following note on Oracle Support; OBIA 7.9.6.4: Bugs Fixed in 7.9.6.4 [[ID 1528774.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1528774.1)]
