As I wrote in my last [blogpost](https://obibb.wordpress.com/2016/02/19/so-oracle-did-not-make-it-to-the-magic-quadrant-for-business-intelligence-and-analytics-platforms/), Gartner's latest [version](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2XXET8P&ct=160204&st=sb) of the Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence and Analytics Platforms ([#BIAMQ](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BIAMQ?src=hash)) caused a lot of noise in the Analytics Market. Gartner and Oracle have different views of this market. [Gartner ](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3198917)sees a difference; "between a modern BI and Analytics Platform and a traditional, IT-centric Reporting and Analysis Platform". I think this; '[Behind the Scenes](http://blogs.gartner.com/cindi-howson/2016/02/10/biamq)' gives some more background about how Gartner has put this Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence and Analytics Platforms together. Find Part 2 of the [#BIAMQ](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BIAMQ?src=hash) story in the [Market Guide for Enterprise-Reporting-Based Platforms](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3211217).


It's clear that Oracle and Gartner have a different view on the Analytics Market. It seems that also the different Analysts see things differently. To get a more complete view of the Analytics Market, it is good to evaluate the Value Index from [Ventana ](http://ht.ly/YoEhK)and the [Forrester Wave™](http://ht.ly/YoBaT) as well.

If you are on Twitter, you should check the following hashtags; [#BalancedBI](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BalancedBI?src=hash), [#BIAMQ](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BIAMQ?src=hash), There are some interesting discussions going on.
