Some more notes about the RittmanMead BI Forum.

Oracle (Phil Bates, Mike Durran, Adam Bloom) came by to show us something about the 11g Release. The closer they get, the lesser they say about release dates. We have to be patient.

The RittmanMead party committee (Ragnar and Paul) took me out for a night on the town. Thanks for that guys!

This morning had some useful tips from [Robin](http://rnm1978.wordpress.com/) about Performance testing in OBIEE.



	
  * (Stick to your) Method

	
  * Use the iterative approach

	
  * Documentation


Elio did his presentation about Complex Modelling. He started by thanking all the (B)loggers out here. Modelling will be one of the key  subjects for the rest of the day.

Keep you posted.
