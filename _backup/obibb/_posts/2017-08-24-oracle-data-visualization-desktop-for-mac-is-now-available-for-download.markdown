Last week Oracle Data Visualization Desktop for Mac became available for [download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/oracle-data-visualization/downloads/oracle-data-visualization-desktop-2938957.html) on OTN.

Unfortunately this version has not (yet) the same capabilities as the Windows version. According to a comment in the following [thread](https://community.oracle.com/thread/4074105) on the Oracle OTN forum there are some issues with 'R' in the Mac version. Therefor the Advanced Analytics functionality is not available. Also because of driver availability DVD for Mac cannot connect to as many datasources as DVD for Windows.

Still for the Mac users amongst us, this is a first step in the 'right' direction.
