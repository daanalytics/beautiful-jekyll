[Anthony Heljula](http://twitter.com/aheljula) notified me about the existence of the [Oracle Support Community](https://communities.oracle.com) on My Oracle Support. This community is more than just a regular forum, like the Oracle BI Forums ([OBIEE](http://forums.oracle.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=378), [OBIA](http://forums.oracle.com/forums/category.jspa?categoryID=147)) . Next to posting and answering questions, it also includes the possibility to share documents and exchange messages.

Oracle's definition; "My Oracle Support Community is a multi-channel interactive community for sharing information, posting questions and answers, and providing suggestions about Oracle products, services, and related technologies. My Oracle Support Community replaces the MetaLink Forums previously accessible from the Forums tab."

You can become a member of this community by subscribing. If you start answering questions, you can improve your rank. I have a long way to go, because I am still a newbie (zero points).........
