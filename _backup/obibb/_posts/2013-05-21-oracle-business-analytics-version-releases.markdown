It has been a busy period over at Oracle with different Oracle Business Analytics software releases. For me personally the following releases attracted my attention:



	
  * Oracle BI EE [11.1.1.7.0](https://blogs.oracle.com/proactivesupportEPM/entry/obiee_11_1_1_7)

	
  * Oracle BIA [11.1.1.7.1](https://blogs.oracle.com/proactivesupportEPM/entry/biapps_11_1_1_7)

	
  * Oracle [Endeca 3.0](https://blogs.oracle.com/emeapartnerbiepm/entry/endeca_information_discovery_version_release)


As always, immediately after a new release of Oracle Business Analytics, there is a lot of buzz within the Oracle BA Community. What did impress me this time was that Oracle added some buzz as well in terms of various Youtube video's. Next to that there is a lot of information online which should help you to get started. I will give an impression of some of the sources I have seen and used.

**Oracle BI EE 11.1.1.7.0**

There is lot of information online. There are two interesting links which are a little bit different than the others.



	
  * Oracle Learning Library - [Oracle BI 11.1.1.7.0 - New Features](http://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:24:106051670304545::NO:24:P24_CONTENT_ID,P24_PREV_PAGE:7109,2)

	
  * Oracle BI Tech Demos on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/OracleBITechDemos)

	
  * Bugs Fixed in 11.1.1.7.0 ([1546028.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/ui/km/DocumentDisplay.jspx?_afrLoop=260795941150356&id=1546028.1&_afrWindowMode=0&_adf.ctrl-state=rl7nqwqnh_17))

	
  * Required and Recommended Patches and Patch Sets for Oracle BI 11g ([1488475.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/ui/km/DocumentDisplay.jspx?_afrLoop=260947625357281&id=1488475.1&_afrWindowMode=0&_adf.ctrl-state=rl7nqwqnh_43))


**Oracle BIA 11.1.1.7.1**

A few weeks ago Oracle BIA 11.1.1.7.1 has gone [GA](http://obibb.wordpress.com/2013/05/07/oracle-business-intelligence-applications-11-1-1-7-ga-on-otn/).

This is a completely new version of Oracle BIA. There are a few interesting blog postings on this release. I provided links to the different blogs. There are probably more postings so have a look around.

Feel free to add if you would like.

Completely off-topic, but nevertheless interesting to add is the following.

Last year I had the privilege to review the [following](http://www.packtpub.com/oracle-business-intelligence-enterprise-edition-11g/book); 'Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition 11g: A Hands-On Tutorial'. For more details on this book, check [here](http://www.obi11gbook.com).

Another interesting book on Oracle BI 11g is the one from Mark [Rittman](http://www.amazon.com/Oracle-Business-Intelligence-Developers-Guide/dp/0071798749); 'Oracle Business Intelligence 11g Developers Guide'

Check the Siebel Essentials site for two [reviews](http://siebel-essentials.blogspot.nl/search/label/Books) about the books above.

One other thing I am working on is translating [BITeamwork](http://www.biteamwork.com) to the Dutch language. BITeamwork is all about Oracle Business Intelligence Collaboration.

As of this weekend the presentations of the RittmanMead BI Forum 2013 (Brighton and Atlanta) are [online](http://www.rittmanmead.com/2013/05/photos-and-presentation-downloads-from-the-rittman-mead-bi-forum-2013-brighton-atlanta/).

That's it for now.
