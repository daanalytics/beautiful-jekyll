Last week [Oracle OpenWorld 2014](https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/focusOnDoc.do?focusID=17898) took place in San Francisco. I did not have the pleasure to attend this event. thanks to the Social Media and the World Wide Web you could be able to follow the highlights. If we check out the [Keynote](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/oracle-openworld-news/thomas-kurian-keynote/index.html) of Thomas Kurian, we can learn that there are three Major Trends;



	
  * Big Data

	
  * Mobility

	
  * Cloud


I have looked at these Trends [earlier](http://obibb.wordpress.com/2014/04/03/big-data-and-analytics-top-ten-trends-for-2014/).


#### Big Data


Just before Oracle OpenWorld 2014, the new updated [Oracle Big Data Information Management Reference Architecture](http://obibb.wordpress.com/2014/09/29/oracle-big-data-information-management-reference-architecture/) has been released. This updated Reference Architecture should place all the (new) technologies in context and next to that it should provide insight into a real, implementable Architecture.

Oracle offers new Big Data capabilities via;



	
  * [Oracle Big Data Discovery](https://cloud.oracle.com/bigdatadiscovery)

	
    * "It’s the visual face of Hadoop”




	
  * [Oracle Big Data SQL](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/big-data-sql/overview/index.html)

	
    * "a recently introduced toolset for working with data across relational and big data systems using Structured Query Language"







#### Mobility


One of the introductions during Oracle Open World is the; [Oracle Mobile Cloud](https://cloud.oracle.com/sites/Satellite?c=Page&cid=1383678930142&d=Touch&pagename=cloudUiSite%2FPage%2FServiceLayout), an end-to-end Mobile Development Framework;



	
  * [Oracle Mobile Application Framework](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/maf/overview/index.html)

	
  * [Mobile Application Accelerator](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/2313779)

	
  * [Oracle Mobile Security](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/identity-management/mobile-security/overview/index.html)


On top of that Oracle has enhanced the integration between Oracle Mobile Application Framework and Oracle Mobile Security Suite. Oracle says the deeper integration makes it easier for mobile front-end developers to secure their applications.
