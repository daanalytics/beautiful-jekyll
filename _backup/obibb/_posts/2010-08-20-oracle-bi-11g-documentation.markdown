All the credits should go to Christian Turri (aka [Turribeach](http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=1114865&tstart=0)) for his investigations and willingness to share.

The Oracle Business Intelligence Documentation could be found in the [Oracle BI Documentation Library](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E14571_01/bi.htm)

The Certification Matrix (Thanks to Joe Bertram als) could be found [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/bi-enterprise-edition/bi-11gr1certmatrix-166168.xls).

Last but not least. Follow this [link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/ias/downloads/fusion-requirements-100147.html#BGBBDBBH) for the Oracle BI 11g Installation System Requirements.

A lot to read but a good place to start, before asking around.
