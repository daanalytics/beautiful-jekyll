In a few days time, the new 11g version of Oracle BI EE  will be launched commercially.  Still John Minkjan wants to spent some time playing around with the 10g version.

If you like a challenge and some competition please [join](http://obiee101.blogspot.com/p/obiee-10g-farewell-competition.html)!

I will be one of the judges, so I am looking forward to your contributions.

Good Luck!!
