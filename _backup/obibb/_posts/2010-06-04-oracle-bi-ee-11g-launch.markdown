There is a lot of rumour on Twitter (hashtags #OBIEE, #11g ) about the launch of the new 11g version of Oracle BI EE yesterday. There will be an official [launch event ](http://www.oracle.com/webapps/events/EventsDetail.jsp?p_eventId=113706&src=7036704&src=7036704&Act=9) in London next month. As Mark Rittman already mentioned, this will probably be a marketing launch. The software on OTN will follow later.

Oracle is testing our patience. The [expectations](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/197910/major_oracle_bi_launch_coming_next_month.html) of this new product are very high.

I can't wait!!
