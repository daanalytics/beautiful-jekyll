Last week I was one of the lucky ones to join the he Rittman Mead BI Forum 2013. This year we were served with a 3-day program. Just like the other years the program was varied. Varied in subjects  (Oracle BI EE, Oracle Endeca, Aggregation Persistence, Big Data, Oracle Exalytics, Oracle BAM /BPM, Cloud, etc.) an varied in in style; Keynotes, one hour presentations, a debate and 10-minute TED-sessions. Next to that the possibility of a Masterclass around Oracle Data Integrator

Just like all the other days the Rittman Mead BI Forum 2013 was an excellent place to network and exchange ideas. Next to the people I knew already I have met a lot of 'new' people. These days were a big inspiration for me. I do not have to be bored the coming year.

Congratulations to [**Antony Heljula**](https://twitter.com/aheljula) for receiving the 'Best Speaker Award' for the second time!

A big thank you to Mark Rittman, Jon Mead and their crew. Also a big thanks to Oracle for joining and for being so open about the Oracle BI developments and their visions and roadmaps. Thanks all for joining and sharing. That’s what makes the Rittman Mead BI Forum such a great event to be at. Hope to see everyone next year.
