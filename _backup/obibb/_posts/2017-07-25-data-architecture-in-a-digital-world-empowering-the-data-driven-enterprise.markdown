If you want to stay ahead of the competition you need to do things differently and preferably better than they do. This means you have to start initiatives. Initiatives which most likely involve an IT component. IT initiatives which are fed by reliable information / insights. These reliable information / insights com from various kinds of data.

To be able to be a really Data Driven, an organisation performs a Data Management [discussion](http://prudenza.typepad.com/dwh/2015/06/make-data-management-a-live-issue-for-discussion-throughout-the-organization.html) throughout the whole organisation.
