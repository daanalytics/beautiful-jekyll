One of the great things of working in the Oracle Business Analytics industry is the fact that there is a very active community. Both online as well as offline. Oracle supports these activities where possible. Last week I attended an offline session at Oracle HQ in the Netherlands. This session was a event organized by the [oGH](https://www.ogh.nl/) and the [OBUG](http://www.obug.be/en/) (the SIG BIWA). [Marti Koppelmans](https://nl.linkedin.com/pub/marti-koppelmans/0/886/385) provided an Introduction into Oracle's Information Management Reference Architecture. As promised he has posted some of his material on the oGH side. If you are interested, have a look at the following;



	
  * [BUSINESS_INTRODUCTIE_VOOR_GEBRUIK_VAN_DE_REFERENTIE_ARCHITECTUUR](https://www.ogh.nl/downloads/OGH20150421_BUSINESS_INTRODUCTIE_VOOR_GEBRUIK_VAN_DE_REFERENTIE_ARCHITECTUUR.pdf)

	
  * [Information Management and Big Data A Reference Architecture](https://www.ogh.nl/downloads/OGH20150421_ORACLE.pdf)

	
  * [BIGDATA_VM_DOWNLOADINFO](https://www.ogh.nl/downloads/OGH20150421_SIG_BIWA_BIGDATA_VM_DOWNLOADINFO.pdf)


Although the titles are in Dutch, the contents are in English.

I will try to leave my notes here whit in a few days
