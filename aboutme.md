I am [Daan Bakboord](http://www.daanbakboord.com), an Oracle Big Data Analytics Consultant from the Netherlands with great interest in anything closely related to the Oracle Business Analytics (OBIEE, BICS, Big Data, Data Integration, Data Visualization). Currently I work as an Oracle Big Data Analytics Managing Consultant for [Quistor](http://www.quistor.com) in the Netherlands.
