I am [Daan Bakboord](http://www.daanbakboord.com), a Self Employed Data & Analytics Consultant (DaAnalytics) from the Netherlands with with a strong focus on  Oracle  Analytics (OAC, OBIEE and Data Visualization) and Cloud Analytics (Matilion, Fivetran, Snowflake, Alteryx  and Looker).

Strong interest in (the Architecture and organisation of) Business Analytics and Data Warehousing in general (TOGAF, ArchiMate, and CBIP) and and Modern Cloud  Analytics Architectures in specific.

[DaAnalytics](http://www.daanalytics.nl) is my personal label. I am partner in [Pong](http://www.pong.nl), responsible for the the Data & Analytics Business Unit. We deliver professional services where we support our clients in their data-driven journey. For Pong, being data-driven means taking action and decisions based on relevant and timely information. Pong offers me the possibility to work together with a number of enthusiastic, experienced entrepreneurial consultants.

Knowledge sharing is important. Therefore I joined the [nl.OUG](http://www.nloug.nl) (Dutch Oracle Usergroup) as a [BIWA](https://www.nloug.nl/sig/biwa/) (Big Data Analytics and Data Integration) SIG (Special Interest Group) Lead. Currently I am also member of the Board and Event Manager.
