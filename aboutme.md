I am [Daan Bakboord](http://www.daanbakboord.com), a Self Employed Oracle Data & Analytics Consultant (DaAnalytics) from the Netherlands with great interest in anything closely related to Oracle Big Data Analytics (OBIEE, BICS, Big Data, Data Integration, Data Visualization).

Next to that, I have a strong interest in (the Architecture and organization of) Business Analytics and Data Warehousing in general (TOGAF, ArchiMate, and CBIP) and Oracle Analytics Architectures in specific. 

I started [DaAnalytics](http://www.daanalytics.nl), to offer Oracle Data Analytics services. The reason I joined [Pong](http://www.pong.nl) is that Pong offers me the possibility to work together with a number of enthusiastic, experienced entrepreneurs. I joined Pong as a Self-Employed Entrepreneur to run the Data & Analytics Business Unit.

Knowledge sharing is important. Therefore I joined the [nl.OUG](http://www.nloug.nl) (Dutch Oracle Usergroup) as a [BIWA](https://www.nloug.nl/sig/biwa/) (Big Data Analytics and Data Integration) SIG (Special Interest Group) Lead.

If you want to get or stay in touch, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daanbakboord/),Â [Twitter](https://twitter.com/daanbakboord), [IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23obihackers&uio=d4) or just sent me an email on <info@daanalytics.nl>.
