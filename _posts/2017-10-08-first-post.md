Welcome to the DaAnalytics Blog. My name is [**Daan Bakboord**](http://www.daanbakboord.com). Online I am also known as **DaAnalytics**. I am Managing Partner at [**Pong**](https://pong.nl), where I am responsible for the Data and Analytics unit.

I have 15+ years experience in Oracle Analytics. Currently I am also focussing on other Modern Cloud Analytics Architectures. These architectures are based around Snowflake. Fivetran and Matillion on the Data Integration side. On the Consumer side tools like; Looker, DataRobot and Dataiku. I am also interested in tools like WhereScape, ERwin and Vaultspeed. 

I will use this blog to share some I code I develop during my experiences in the world of Data and Analytics. Next to this blog I also maintain a blog on [**DaAnalytics**](https://daanalytics.nl/blog) and some of my blogs are also available on [**Medium**](https://medium.com/@daanalytics).

Looking forward to share some insights here. 

More to come.
